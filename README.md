# qr-business-card

Create a QR code replacement for a business card. Very basic implementation.

Instructions:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install qrcode[pil] vobject`
2. Edit `qrbc.py` to replace the `"UPDATE"` fields with your details.
3. Run with `python3 qrbc.py`
4. Your new QR code is saved as `businesscard.png` in the current folder by default. You can change this by editing the `FILENAME` variable.
